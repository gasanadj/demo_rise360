            <strong>Best Tomato Planting Practices:</strong>
            Tomatoes grow best in temperatures between 15째C to 35째C.
            Temperatures below 10째C and above 40째C can significantly affect the
            growth and development of tomatoes.Tomato seeds should be sown in a
            nursery bed and transplanted to the field when they are between 6-8
            weeks old. The spacing between tomato plants should be 60cm to 90cm
            apart, while the spacing between rows should be 90cm to 120cm apart.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Best Fertilizers for Tomato Farms:</strong> Top-dress the
            plants after 4 weeks with CAN or UREA at 50kgs per acre. Keep the
            field free from weeds particularly in the first 30 days. Avoid hand
            weeding as this may destroy the delicate roots. Apply AMBAR at
            30ml/20ltrs between the rows and plants, to suppress any seed weeds
            before they sprout, and to kill any growing broad-leafed weeds. Use
            the appropriate nozzle for best results. AMBAR works best when weeds
            are not higher than 4 inches and smaller than the tomato plants.
            During flower set, apply another dose of Harmony 30-40ml/20ltrs
            targeting the flower buds. You can also mix with soluble foliar
            fertilisers which have high potassium and calcium. This will avoid
            calcium end rot and other related fruit diseases later on, as well
            as protect against flower/fruit abortion. After flower set, avoid
            fertilizers which are rich in nitrogen, eg CAN, NPK, Urea. Irrigate
            to keep the soil moist, without being soggy or muddy. An irrigation
            cycle of twice a week using 10,000 to 20,000ltrs per acre is usually
            sufficient for tomatoes.

            <strong>Pest management for Tomato:</strong>
            Scout for signs of Blight, Mildew, Canker. Be careful especially
            during cool wet conditions when blight is most active. Apply an
            early spray of Stage 20ml/20ltrs as a precaution against blight, and
            repeat after 7 days if conditions are cold and wet. Scout for any
            signs of disease after this, and apply Stage 250 EW in weekly
            intervals if noticed. Mix every application with Harmony
            30-40ml/20ltrs to aid plant vigour, and recovery from stress. Check
            for signs of insect damage every day particularly in warm dry
            conditions. The most serious pests include spider mite, leaf minor
            (tuta absoluta), thrips, whitefly, caterpillars and aphids. All of
            these can cause serious damage and should be controlled as much as
            possible. Also, check vegetation around edges of the field. Spray
            JACKPOT 12.5 ml/20Ltr to control aphids, and worms, particularly at
            fruit set, before the moths can lay their eggs on the fruits. Spray
            a mix of ROMECTIN 20ml/20ltre, and IMAXI 12.5ml/ltr to control
            stubborn leaf minors and red spider mites. Spray BAMAKO 5gms/20ltrs
            on the crop in the evening and around the edges of the field to
            control whitefly.

            <strong>Storage techniques for Tomato:</strong>
            The tomatoes should be ready for harvesting as from the 70th day
            onwards depending on the variety planted. Remove the ripe fruits
            from the stems carefully and place in clean disinfected containers
            ready for transport.

            <strong>Best Lettuce Planting Practices:</strong>
            Lettuce prefers a location with 5 to 6 hours of sun, but can benefit
            from afternoon shade when temperatures soar. Soil should be loose,
            well-draining, and moist but not soggy. In the weeks prior to
            planting, amend with plenty of compost for added fertility.Soil
            temperatures between 45°F and 65°F (7°C and 18°C) are ideal.
            Cold-adapted varieties can survive much lower temperatures. Direct
            sowing is recommended. Sow seeds in the ground 2 to 4 weeks before
            your last spring frost date or as soon as the ground can be
            worked.Since the seed is so small, a well-tilled seedbed is
            essential. Stones and large clods of dirt will inhibit germination.
            Plant seeds 1/8 to 1/4 of an inch deep. Lettuce seeds need light to
            germinate, so don’t sow them too deep. Seeds may be sown in single
            rows or broadcast for wide row planting (loose-leaf varieties are
            best for this). When broadcasting, thin 1- to 2-inch tall seedlings
            for the proper spacing. Spacing between plants depends on the
            variety: Loose-leaf lettuce: Plant or thin to 4 inches apart.
            Romaine (cos) and butterhead (loose-head, Bibb, Boston) lettuce:
            Plant or thin to 8 inches apart. Crisphead (iceberg) lettuce: Plant
            or thin to 16 inches apart. Set rows of lettuce 12 to 15 inches
            apart. Sow additional seeds every 2 weeks for a continuous harvest.
            Consider planting rows of chives or garlic between your lettuce to
            control aphids. They act as “barrier plants” for the lettuce. Water
            thoroughly with a mist nozzle at time of transplanting or seeding.

            <strong>Best Fertilizers for Lettuce Farms:</strong>Fertilize 3
            weeks after transplanting with organic alfalfa meal or another
            slow-release fertilizer to provide a steady stream of nitrogen.

            <strong>Pest management for Lettuce:</strong>
            Grow companion plants; knock off with water spray; apply
            insecticidal soap; put banana or orange peels around plants; wipe
            leaves with a 1 to 2 percent solution of dish soap (no additives)
            and water every 2 to 3 days for 2 weeks; add native plants to invite
            beneficial insects Cutworms Insect Wilting; severed stems of
            seedlings and transplants just above or below soil line; whole
            seedlings disappear Handpick; in spring before planting, cultivate
            soil to reduce larvae; wrap a 4-inch-wide collar made from cardboard
            or newspaper around each stem, sinking 2 inches into soil; weed; use
            row covers; destroy crop residue Earwigs Insect Many small holes in
            leaves/stems Create an earwig trap by placing a tuna can filled with
            1/2 inch of fish oil and sinking it into the soil such that edge is
            slightly above ground level; remove plant debris Lettuce mosaic
            virus Virus Leaves may show green mottling or brown spots and can be
            distorted, blistered, curled backward; plants stunted; heads may be
            distorted or fail to form Destroy infected plants; choose resistant
            varieties and certified virus-free seed; use row covers; disinfect
            garden tools; weed; control aphids

            <strong>Harvesting and Storage techniques for Lettuce:</strong>
            Harvest lettuce in the morning when full-size but young and tender.
            Check your garden every day for ready-to-harvest leaves; mature
            lettuce gets bitter and woody and will go bad quickly. Before
            maturity, you can harvest leaf lettuce by simply removing the outer
            leaves so that the center leaves can continue to grow. Harvest
            butterhead, romaine, and loose-leaf types by removing the outer
            leaves, digging up the whole plant, or cutting the plant about an
            inch above the soil surface. A second harvest is often possible when
            using the first or third methods. Crisphead lettuce is picked when
            the center is firm.Store lettuce in a loose plastic bag in the
            refrigerator for up to 10 days. When ready to use, put the harvested
            lettuce in cold water for a few minutes. Then, place in a salad
            spinner or towel. Spin the spinner to remove water from the lettuce.
            Lettuce leaves have wilted? Put the leaves in a bowl of cold water
            with ice cubes and soak for about 15 minutes.

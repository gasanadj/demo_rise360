            <strong>Best Coffee Planting Practices:</strong>
            While you can't germinate the coffee beans you buy in a store, you
            can sprout the ones that grow on your coffee plant. Called
            "cherries," the fruit should be picked when they're a bright crimson
            color. This is how you'll know they're ready to sow. Rub away their
            flesh and wash away any residue to release the seeds or beans. Dry
            them thoroughly by sitting in the open air for a few weeks. Soak the
            beans in water for 24 hours (toss any that float), and sow in damp,
            but well-draining, sand. Water daily, and the beans should germinate
            in two to four months. When they've germinated, carefully remove
            them and plant each one in well-draining, acidic soil. Water twice a
            week.

            <strong>Best Fertilizers for Coffee Farms:</strong>The coffee
            plant’s need for zinc, iron, copper, sulfur, manganese, boron,
            magnesium, sodium and chlorine, is something to keep in mind. It is
            a micronutrient-hungry plant, and these micronutrients can provide
            the plant with just the correct nourishment for its optimum growth.
            When selecting a fertilizer with these micronutrients, make sure to
            go for the ones that have a healthy NPK level. NPK indicates the
            macronutrient content of the fertilizer, which are Nitrogen (N),
            Phosphorus (P), and Potassium (K). Nitrogen too is an essential
            component.

            <strong>Pest management for Coffee:</strong>
            The Leucoptera coffeella Guer is a small insect that is a
            significant pest of coffee plants. It is a tiny, light-colored moth
            with large antennas. It is native to South America and is found in
            coffee-growing regions worldwide. The female moth lays its eggs on
            the undersides of coffee leaves. After about a week, the larvae
            hatch and burrow into the leaves to feed for about 3 weeks. This
            feeding causes damage to the leaf tissue, resulting in visible brown
            spots or “mines” that can reduce the foliage and photosynthetic
            ability of the coffee tree if found in large numbers. The population
            of coffee leaf miners reaches its peak during the summer but
            decreases significantly during the rainy season. Control: Using
            agroforestry practices that will maintain the temperature in your
            plantation. High temperatures might allow it to proliferate.
            Chemical control is again the most effective solution, but it should
            only be used when they are found in high numbers.

            <strong>Harvesting and Storage for Coffee:</strong>
            The time between blooming and maturing of the fruit varies
            appreciably with the variety and the climate; for Arabica it is
            about seven months and for Robusta about nine months. The ripened
            fruits of the coffee plant are known as coffee cherries, and each
            cherry generally contains two coffee seeds (“beans”) positioned flat
            against one another. About 5 percent of cherries contain only one
            seed; called peaberries, those single seeds are smaller and denser
            and produce, in the opinion of some, a sweeter, more flavourful
            coffee. The fruit is gathered by hand when it is fully ripe and
            red-purple in colour.

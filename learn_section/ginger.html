            <strong>Best Ginger Planting Practices:</strong>
            Ginger loves hot, humid conditions and rich soil with lots of
            nutrients. In our cool climate the plants do well in full sun; in
            more southern locations the plants may need partial shade. You can
            buy ginger online from seed companies, but you can also purchase
            organic ginger from your local market. When purchasing ginger
            rhizomes for planting, look for light-colored, thin-skinned organic
            ginger that is plump and firm with several bumpy nodules.To prepare
            ginger for planting, cut rhizomes into 2″-3″ pieces (each piece
            containing at least 2 to 3 nodules). Allow cut ends to dry and heal
            over before planting.
          </p>

            <strong>Best Fertilizers for Ginger Farms:</strong>
            While ginger is growing, you can add a few inches of compost to
            growing ginger sprouts, similar to “hilling” potatoes. This can
            encourage more growth in the rhizomes. If your ginger is not growing
            well, consider feeding every few weeks with an organic fertilizer
            such as liquid seaweed or fish emulsion. Testing your soil will help
            you know exactly what the soil is lacking.

            <strong>Pest management for Ginger:</strong>
            Usually healthy, although red spider mite can be an occasional
            problem. Increasing the humidity by misting plants twice daily with
            warm water helps discourage these pests. To control shoot borer and
            leaf roller, the spray of indoxacarb of 10 ml per 15 litre of water
            or novaluron of 10 ml per 15 litre of water is very effective if
            sprayed at 15 days interval. Rhizome scale insects destroys rhizome
            and it can be controlled by dipping the seed rhizome in quinalphos
            by dissolving 1 ml in 1 litre of water. To avoid rhizome rot, good
            drainage and treatment of the seed rhizome with dissolving 3 gm of
            combination of carbendazim and mancozeb (readily available in the
            market) in 1 litre of water for nearly 30 minutes, before storage
            should be done. Bacterial wilt which causes milky ooze as gentle
            pressing of rhizomes and can be effectively controlled by treating
            the seed rhizome with dissolving 2 gm of streptocycln in 1 litre of
            water for 30 minutes.

            <strong>Storage techniques for Ginger:</strong>
            In cool climates, harvest ginger all at once before freezing
            temperatures. In warmer climates, harvest ginger after the leaves
            begin to yellow and die back. Wait to harvest as long as possible
            for the largest rhizomes.To harvest, gently dig up the entire plant.
            In warm areas, you can leave the ginger in the ground and harvest as
            needed. Plants will go dormant during the cooler months and shorter
            days of winter, but new shoots will emerge in the spring.After
            harvesting ginger, rinse it well and then cut off shoots and large
            roots. Use the leaves in tea.Store fresh ginger in the refrigerator
            or freezer in plastic resealable bags. Unpeeled ginger keeps for
            about a month in the refrigerator or up to a year frozen. Dehydrate
            ginger by peeling (young, fresh ginger may not need to be peeled)
            and slicing. Dehydrate at 95°F for 8-12 hours or until ginger is
            crisp and breaks when bent.

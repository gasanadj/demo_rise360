            <strong>Best Beans Planting Practices:</strong>
            Beans are sensitive to cold temperatures and frost and should be
            planted around the average last frost date in the spring. The exact
            date depends a lot upon the condi­tion of the soil — it must have
            warmed to 60°F and started to dry out. Seeds should be planted about
            one inch deep. Plant bush beans about two to three inches apart in
            rows two feet wide. Pole beans can be planted four to six inches
            apart in rows three feet wide. Alternatively, four to six seeds can
            be planted in hills centered about 30 inches apart. Plan to plant
            suc­cessive crops every two to four weeks for an extended harvest
            season (usually until late July in northern areas).The best sites
            have full sun (partial shade is tolerated but will reduce the
            yield), well-drained soil (but consistently moist), average
            fertility (too rich of a soil will produce an excess of foliage at
            the expense of beans), slightly acidic soil pH (6 to 6.8), and good
            air circulation.

            <strong>Best Fertilizers for Beans Farms:</strong>The application of
            fertilizers After sowing by fertigation is important in order to
            increase the availability of nutrients. It is important to include
            nitrate fertilizer relatively frequently (with every irrigation
            cycle) until well-developed foliage has been built up. Potassium
            should be applied in increased amounts while pods are starting their
            intensive development. K/N ratio should preferably be 3/1. Multi-K
            is absolutely essential at this stage as sole K source because it is
            fully water soluble and chloride-free. Potassium nitrate is fully
            consumed by the plants and thus, no salts will accumulate in the
            soil. This is therefore, the only way to avoid salinity, to which
            this crop is extremely sensitive. Multi-K is advantageous also due
            to the K/N ratio of 3/1 found in it.

            <strong>Pest management for Beans:</strong>
            Look for clusters of yellow eggs hanging vertically from the
            underside of the snap or lima bean leaves (they also like soybeans
            and other types, too) in early summer. Soon fuzzy, bright yellow
            insects will appear and start feeding on bean leaves — these are the
            Mexican bean beetle larvae, which are very destructive as they
            skeletonize the leaves. The adult does less damage and looks like a
            yellow-orange ladybug with eight black spots in rows on each wing.
            The adult is a good flyer and can travel far to find new bean
            fields. The beetles overwinter in moist, protected debris. Control
            measures include cultivating to destroy overwintering locations;
            handpicking eggs, larvae or adults; using floating row covers;
            planting a heavy bean crop in the spring (beetle popula­tions are
            heaviest later in the summer); using a trap crop; using predators;
            spraying with azadirachtin, garlic, cedar oil, or mineral oil; and
            planting less-preferred types like mung beans, cowpea, and soybeans.
            This is one of the top insect pests in many areas.

            <strong>Harvesting and Storage techniques for Beans:</strong>
            The best time to pick the various snap beans is when they are still
            young and aren’t tough and stringy (July to frost). Since beans
            ripen at different times on the same bush, it is best to check them
            daily. Picking the beans frequently encourages more to form.
            Skipping a day may send some pods into the inedible category and
            slow down production since the plant thinks it has accomplished its
            goal of producing seed. Most beans should snap nicely from the
            plant. Select beans that are firm, pencil thickness (or less),
            tender, and medium green. Harvest only when bean plants are dry to
            avoid bacterial blight, a serious bean disease. Cut off the tougher
            stem and tip end and they are ready for cooking (or eating fresh).
            Store pods unwashed in a tight container in the refrigerator, then
            wash and use as soon as possible. After several days beans may get
            wilty or tough. If they can’t be used fresh within three or four
            days, the pods can be blanched and frozen, canned, or pickled.

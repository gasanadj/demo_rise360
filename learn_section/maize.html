            <strong>Best Maize Planting Practices:</strong>
            Planting depth of maize varies from 5 to 10 cm, depending on the
            soil type and planting date. As a rule, planting should be shallower
            in heavier soils than in sandy soils.Plant population per unit area
            is more important than specific row width. Row widths under dryland
            conditions can vary from 0,91 m to 2,1 or 2,3 m, depending on
            mechanical equipment available and type of soil tillage system used.

            <strong>Best Fertilizers for Maize Farms:</strong> It is of the
            utmost importance that the correct soil sampling methods be used
            when submitting samples for laboratory analysis. Recommended
            sampling methods to be used are available in the Fertilizer
            Guidelines for Maize, and can be obtained from: The Director,
            ARC-GCI, Private Bag X1251, Potchefstroom 2520. Recommendations
            supplied by the Institute should be strictly adhered to, to obtain
            the required results in the field.

            <strong>Pest management for Maize:</strong>
            Integrated pest management is a system whereby various strategies
            are used to protect crops by suppressing the insect population and
            limiting damage. These management practices incorporate all
            practical methods of pest control in a pest management system. These
            measures include chemical control, biological control, plant
            resistance and cultivation control. Preventive control Although
            preventive control measures may often seem to be “effective”, this
            effectiveness can be 28 ascribed to relatively low population levels
            of specific insects during certain years, when epidemic outbreaks do
            not occur. If very high infection levels do occur during epidemic
            years, preventive control will be ineffective and large losses may
            be experienced. It is therefore important to determine the
            infestation level before spraying or seed treatments are applied.
            Cultivation control This implies that pest populations are
            suppressed by cultivation practices, which are detrimental to the
            pest. These practices include soil cultivation during winter,
            eradicating volunteer plants, cultivar choice and adapting planting
            times. Biological control Natural control of pests occurs
            continually in fields where natural enemies attack all the
            life-stages of insect pests. Aphids and hibernating larvae of stem
            borers in particular are killed by natural enemies. The natural
            enemy complex can be protected to a certain extent by using
            insecticides which are more environmentally friendly, and which are
            not very toxic to nontarget organisms. Insect-resistant plants The
            use of plants which are resistant to insects, is extremely
            beneficial, because of both short and long-term benefits. The
            short-term benefit of plant resistance is that it limits pest
            damage, while economic threshold values are often not reached.

            <strong>Storage techniques for Maize:</strong>
            Maize is predominantly harvested mechanically, although exceptions
            do occur in the case of hand harvesting. Hand harvesting The entire
            plant can be cut and placed into stacks (stook) while still green.
            Once it is dry, the ears 31 can be picked and threshed, or the
            entire plant with the ear can be utilised as maize hay.
            Alternatively, the plants can be left in the field to dry and the
            ears harvested. Mechanical harvesting In South Africa, maize is
            usually left in the field until moisture percentages of 12,5 to 14,0
            are reached before it is harvested and delivered to a silo.

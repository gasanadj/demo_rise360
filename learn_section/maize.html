            <strong>Best Cassava Planting Practices:</strong>
            The cultivation of cassava always starts with stem cuttings. These
            cuttings are planting materials obtained from the stem of cassava
            plants harvested and at least 10 months old. Once the cassava tubers
            are harvested, the stems are cut off from the tubers, and the leaves
            are removed. Then the stems are stored in a dry and cool place for
            the next planting season. It has been observed that stem cuttings
            below the base of the plants give good starch yields. Cuttings
            material from the upper stems produced fewer yields [1,2,3]. It is
            thus recommended that farmers make use of cuttings from the lower
            part of the stem. A good stem cutting for planting cassava should:
            Be 20-30 cm long and about 1.5-4.0 cm thick, Have 2 to 3 viable buds
            [4,5,6] Taking 1/3 of the total length of the stem from the top is
            considered the best for planting.

            <strong>Best Fertilizers for Cassava Farms:</strong> A basal dose of
            15 tonnes of farmyard manure along with a chemical fertilizers of
            Nitrogen(N:50kg), Phosphorus(P:50kg) and Potash(O:50kg)per hectare
            should be applied at the time of land preparation. Subsequently, a
            dose of 50kg "N" and 50kg "P" should be applied along with the first
            intercultural operations 50-60 days after planting.

            <strong>Pest management for Cassava:</strong>
            Microbial control is a special form of biological control in which
            the natural enemies are “microbes” (fungi, bacteria, or viruses)
            that kill the pests by causing diseases in them. These “microbial
            control agents” may occur naturally on cassava farms and, like other
            natural enemies, they do their job without harming the crop or
            affecting people. Fungi have been found that kill the variegated
            grasshopper. The fungi are spread as “spores” which are like tiny
            seeds. The spores land on a pest, germinate, and the fungus then
            penetrates the body of the pest, growing and killing it within a few
            days. W hen a diseased grasshopper dies, its dead body may remain
            firmly gripped to the plant or drop to the ground. “Biopesticides”
            consisting of fungus spores mixed in oil are being prepared by
            scientists as commercial products against the grasshopper. The
            product can be sprayed on weeds such as the Siam weed, Chromolaena
            odorata, to kill newly hatched nymphs which gather in large numbers
            on the weed. The product can also be sprayed directly on cassava to
            kill nymphs and adults of the grasshopper on the plant.

            <strong>Storage techniques for Cassava:</strong>
            Cut the plant at about 30 –50 cm above the ground; use the stem to
            lift the roots. Pull the plant gently and do not drag the roots.
            Dragging can cause bruises and cuts which may lead to early
            deterioration Cassava roots start deteriorating soon after
            harvesting. Internal discoloration and loss of marketing value occur
            if they are not cooked or processed within 24 – 48 hour of
            harvesting. Secondary fungi and bacteria infection may cause rot in
            untreated roots

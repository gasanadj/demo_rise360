            <strong>Best Onion Planting Practices:</strong>
            Plant onions in the spring when the ground thaws and the temperature
            remains above 28 degrees Fahrenheit. Sunny spots with loose soil and
            a neutral pH are best. Leave at least 6 inches between each plant,
            spacing onion rows about 1 foot apart to allow room for the maturing
            plants to spread.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Best Fertilizers for Onion Farms:</strong>Use a
            macro-nutrient-rich fertilizer, like SUPERthrive Organic All-Purpose
            Plant Food, to feed the plant as it grows. This type of fertilizer
            can help with nutrient and water intake. Apply just prior to
            planting and then every four to six weeks during the growing season
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Pest management for Onion:</strong>
            Thrips: These small, yellowish-brown flying insects feed on leaves
            and can cause twisting and curling. Repeated attacks cause the
            foliage to stop growing, so the onion bulbs don’t mature. Plant
            resistant varieties, and don’t plant onions near grain crops. Neem
            oil and insecticidal soaps can provide temporary control. Onion root
            maggots: Root maggot larvae hatch from eggs laid by brown flies near
            the base of onion plants. The maggots burrow into the stems, feeding
            on the plants below the soil and eventually killing the onions.
            Rotate plants to a different location each year to avoid
            infestation. Using row covers for seedlings can prevent eggs from
            being laid. And diatomaceous earth can also be effective.

            <strong>Harvesting and Storage techniques for Onion:</strong>
            You can harvest young onions just a few weeks after planting if you
            want to use them as "spring onions" or scallions. There is no
            perfect size, just pull when they are big enough to suit you. For
            full-sized bulbs, let onions grow and mature. They are ready to
            harvest when the bulbs are big and the tops begin to turn yellow and
            fall over. Pull them up, shake off the soil, and lay them out to
            cure with the tops still attached. Any warm, airy location is a good
            place to do this; you can even sling them over a fence as long as
            they aren't rained upon. Bulbs must stay dry and have good air
            circulation. As the onions cure, the roots will shrivel and the
            necks above the bulbs will slowly dry – a natural process that helps
            to seal the top of the bulb, making the onions less likely to rot.
            After 7 to 10 days, clip off the tops of the onions and the roots
            with pruning shears, remove as much dry dirt as possible without
            taking off the papery outer skins, and store your onions in a cool
            place. Very sweet, juicy onions may be stored, wrapped in newspaper
            or paper towels, in the fridge.
